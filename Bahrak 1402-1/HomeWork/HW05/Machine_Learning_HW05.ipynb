You should use the `RandomForestClassifier`, `KNeighborsClassifier`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`, and `AdaBoostClassifier`. Compare your results (number of dimensions, accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and confusion matrix) and explain why the number of dimensions for different models are different.

        "Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that involves combining the predictions of multiple models to improve the overall performance and accuracy of a system. Instead of relying on a single model to make predictions, ensemble methods use a group of models and aggregate their predictions to achieve better results than any individual model could achieve on its own.\n",

Ensemble methods are often used to enhance predictive accuracy, reduce overfitting, and improve the robustness of the model.\n",

The predictions of these models are then averaged or voted upon to make the final prediction.\n",
